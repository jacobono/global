Installation of GNU GLOBAL under Windows 32

1. Required programs.

You need following programs to install and execute GLOBAL for Windows 32.

o Borland C++ compiler 5.0 or later.

	http://community.borland.com/

o GNU sed and sort for Windows 32.
	It may be downloaded at:
	http://www.edv.agrar.tu-muenchen.de/~syring/win32/UnxUtils.html

2. How to install.

Setup above programs and path for them then try this:

C:\global>xcopy /s w32\*.* .

C:\global>make		<- Invoke make.bat

C:\global>make install

C:\global>mkdir \tmp

C:\global>make clean


3. Some notes about GLOBAL for Windows 32.

Global requires the GNU programs sed.exe, sort.exe be the path.
Note that the sort that comes with Windows does not support multikey sorting
which is required by global. To avoid using that version of sort, the directory
containing the GNU version must be first in your PATH.

All paths are expected to use the UNIX directory separator '/' instead of
the DOS/Windows '\'. This includes the Global-specific environment variables
as well as paths given on command lines.  However, the path separators
expected for the PATH and GTAGSLIBPATH environment variables are expected
to be the DOS-style ';' instead of the UNIX-style ':'.

Global 4.0 has been tested under Windows NT 4.0 with Borland C++ 5.5.
