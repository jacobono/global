Frequentry Asked Questions about GLOBAL.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. Htags(1) aborts by short of memory. Why? Any workaround?

	% htags
	Out of memory!
	% _

A1. It seems that Perl4 and some Perl5 leaks memory.
    Please replace it with the latest Perl(currently 5.6.0) and retry.

    If it occurs with Perl-5.6.0 or later, please let me know.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2. GLOBAL skip some functions.
    For example, GLOBAL skip the function 'func' in this example.

	#define M(a)	static char *string = a;

	M(a)

	func() {		<= GLOBAL skip func().
		...
	}

A2. GLOBAL cannot recognize that pattern, because M(a) seems to be
    a function definition.

    It should be follows.

	#define M(a)	static char *string = a

	M(a);			<= end with ';'

	func() {
		...
	}

    Otherwise, you can tell gtags(1) that by listing the macros in
    '.notfunction' file in current directory.

	[.notfunction]
	+---------------
	|M
	|...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3. I have set up 'global.conf' to use emacs's ctags command with GLOBAL
    but I cannot use htags.

	% gtags
	% htags
	htags: GTAGS and GRTAGS not found. Please make them.
	% ls G*
	GPATH   GTAGS

A3. Emacs's ctags cannot locate function referencies. So, gtags cannot make
    GRTAGS tag file with it. With the result that you cannot use htags and
    global's -r option.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4. The man program on my machine does not understand the manual files
    in GLOBAL

A4. Online manuals in GLOBAL are written with 'mandoc' macro which is a part
    of GNU groff package. You can format these manuals by following command
    line manually.

        % groff -Wall -Tascii -mandoc global.1

    If you replace your system's nroff(1) with GNU's one(nroff.sh) then
    you can use man(1) to see GLOBAL's online manuals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5. I have built GLOBAL in Windows 32 environment. But gtags(1) failed by sort
    command error.

A5. It seems that MS sort is executed. Please set your path so that unix
    sort will be executed.
