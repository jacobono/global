The GLOBAL was written by Shigio Yamaguchi.

The DB library was written by Mike Olson.

Port to Windows 32 (for Borland C++ Compiler) by Dan Fandrich.
(w32/INSTALL, w32/machine/unistd.h and most of #ifdef _WIN32.)

There are also many others who have contributed patches and fixes.
Please see files ChangeLog and THANKS.

Note: GLOBAL is distributed with the files:
	regex.c, regex.h, getopt.c, getopt1.c and getopt.h
they are considered a separate package, not part of GLOBAL proper.
